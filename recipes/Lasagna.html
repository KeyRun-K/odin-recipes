    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>With layer upon layer of rich tomatoey beef mince, pasta, and creamy cheesy sauce, it’s hard to find anything to
        dislike about lasagne. There are numerous reasons why this particular lasagne recipe has become so beloved. The
        addition of wine in the red sauce makes it super flavourful, while the layering of pasta with mozzarella makes
        for the perfect cheese pull. But if we were to pick one thing that makes this lasagne recipe stand out above all
        others, it’s the luscious bechamel sauce. A good home-made bechamel base takes time - but it’s worth it for the
        extra depth of flavour you won’t find with many lasagnes.</p>
    <p>The best thing about rich Italian ragu and lasagne is that it tastes even better the next day, even when heated
        in the microwave. This lasagne recipe is also freezer-friendly and will keep for up to 3 months in an airtight
        container. You can actually wrap individual portions in freezer wrap, ready to take out for a quick and easy
        dinner-for-one. This lasagne recipe is an absolute favourite among the taste team (hence the name!), but don ’t
        just take my word for it - our members are raving about it too. One reviewer even said she made it for her
        husband “who grew up eating lasagna his Italian mother cooked him” (no pressure!) and “he thoroughly enjoyed”
        it. With a 4.5-star rating and multiple rave reviews, it’s safe to say this recipe is now an adopted Aussie
        classic</p>
